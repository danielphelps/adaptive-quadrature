##adaptive-quadrature
You found a Clojure implementation of Simpson's Adaptive Quadrature.  
There are a few methods for numerically computing an integral.  Ideally,
the method you choose would consider the behavior of the function you wish 
to integrate. If you have some singularity, or "near" singularity ugliness, 
in your function, your user would want to measure smaller pieces under the 
funky part of the curve.  See 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration 
and
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adaptive_Simpson's_method
for more information.

## Usage

Suppose we want to integrate a real valued function f, of one argument, 
over [a, b] with accuracy eps and no more than n iterations (call depth, in
our case).  We would write:
  (adaptive-quadrature f a b eps n)

The unit tests lay out some concrete examples for us:

  (let [a 0 
        b 1 
        n 22 
        eps 1.0E-6 
        actual (/ 2 3.)
        f sqrt]
    (adaptive-quadrature f a b eps n))
